##User Stories

- As a stakeholder I want the public to have a better way to access the data Seattle makes pubilically available.
- As a stakeholder it is important that the information is transparent and factually accurate.
- As a stakeholder I want patrons to be drawn in by interesting facts on the landing page.
- As a developer I want the website to be modular in design to accomodate future growth and expanded functionality.

##Website Mission

This website's mission mirrors that of the library, in the spirit of education and ready access to knowledge for which our humble institute, dedicated to coding takes it's name. Code Fellows has a mission much like the Seattle Library in that it's greatest virtue is the expansion of the human mind. In fellowship, and with the tools publically available, we endeavor to gain wisdom and understanding thru the disemination of information to the public that is of interest and value to all.

*Seattle Reads is a program of the Seattle Public Library and more information can by found at their official website: (ABOUT SEATTLE READS)[http://www.spl.org/audiences/adults/seattle-reads]*

          "Seattle Reads is designed to deepen engagement in literature through reading and discussion. Seattle Reads The Turner House is made possible by The Seattle Public Library Foundation and The Wallace Foundation, with additional support from media sponsors The Seattle Times and KUOW 94.9 Public Radio, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt."

This website uses data made available by the Seattle Public Library in the form of a publically accessible API.(Explore the Seattle Public Library API Here)[https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.seattle.gov/tjb6-zsmc] Designed in a manner to be open source and using standard processes our team is dedicated to this site's mission. As students ourselves, mindful of the ever changing field of software development, staying informed and reliant on engaged communities supporting each other is key to any great success. Adopting the agile method of team work, using best practice and paired programming to peer review each other's coding and merging our ideas into action. Dedicated to the humble patron of Seattle's public library and the grace and dignity we lend to fulfilling the selfless mission of teaching, it is our pleasure to assist in this shared egalitarian goal.
